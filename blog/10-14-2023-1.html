    <h1 class="centered-text intro-header">Calculus is really fun.</h1>
    <div class="main-padding">
        <p>You probably think I am insane for saying that. While I do not deny my insanity, I think that I am right in
            this instance. Think about it. Calculus deals with infinities! My favorite kind of finity. Integrals and
            derivatives are so much fun. And the things that emerge when you use them are even more fun.</p>
        <p>Like did you know that if you plot your speed over time on a graph, then take the integral of that, you get
            your distance covered! If you take the derivative of it instead, you get your acceleration! If you then take
            the derivative of that, you get the jerk. I only learned about jerk recently, but essentially, it is the
            change in acceleration. Thats really all a derivative is, if you boil it down. The derivative of a function
            tells you how the graph is changing.</p>
        <p>All this to say, even though I took AP Calculus (and got a 4 on the test may I add) I have picked up a book
            from the library on the AP Calculus exam and I plan on relearning it. I just find Calculus to be so fun. It
            is without a doubt my favorite kind of math. Limits can be confusing but are so much fun because they can be
            used to essentially divide by zero! Did you know that in some ways, when you divide by zero, the answer is
            basically infinity! I know that sounds crazy but I'll explain it.</p>
        <p>So this limit doesn't actually exist. What I mean is that since you cannot divide by zero (as this limit
            actually does a good job of showing). This limit does a good job of showing is limits that do not exist
            because if you "approach" it from the two different sides of the graph, you get different answers. Observe
            the following, a graph of (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>x</sub>).</p>

            alt="Graph of 1 over x from Desmos">
        <p>Think about this graph logically. Think about approaching from the right, or positive side. The denominator
            (x) would keep getting closer and closer to 0, which in turn makes the output (y) greater. This is why it
            tends
            to infinity. Now think about it from the other direction. The denominator (x) is getting closer and closer
            to zero again. But this time, it is also negative. This means that in turn the output (y) is getting smaller
            and smaller, tending to negative infinity.</p>
        <p>What I find the most interesting about this limit is how it applies to black holes. Did you know that the
            reason we say that black holes have infinite density is because we are actually dividing by zero in our
            equations somewhere! This is because the radius of the mass of the black hole is approaching zero.</p>
        <p>Isn't that really cool! This is just one taste of how fun Calculus can be. You should look into learning just a bit of Calculus if you enjoy math at all.</p>
