        <p>It was a day just like any other. I, my mom, my little brother

            , and a foster care kid were walking
            along
            the trail near our house like we often do. We did this walk quite frequently. It was a nice little trail
            through
            the woods and near a creek. It is always beneficial for your mental health to get out of the house and
            experience nature.
        </p>
        <p>Soon, however, this walk was anything but beneficial. Before I get into what happened that made this one of
            the
            few days from this time that I vividly remember, let me give you some background on <span class="tooltip"
                style="margin: 0px;">
                Frank

            </span>. We adopted him
            when
            he was about four years old. The day when we brought him home for good was a horrible one. The people at the
            adoption agency who were supposed to help us did not help us at all. It felt as if he spent the whole
            three-hour
            drive home screaming and yelling that he did not want this. Please do not think that this reflects poorly on
            my
            parents. Think how you would feel if you were being told that you had new parents and that you had to say
            goodbye to the only mom that you knew for your entire life.</p>
        <p>Our home life was not much better. Around the time when this story takes place, it felt like his fits were
            constant. Being at home or even around him was so hard. It felt like any little thing might set him off, and
            he
            would yell and stomp and throw a fit again. That is what happened on the trail that fateful day. I do not
            recall
            what was said. It probably was not much of anything, as just about anything could set him off. Before we
            knew
            it, he was running off into the woods.</p>
        <p>Mom and I yelled after him a bit to just please come back. He did not care what we had to say, as he was
            quite
            stubborn. Eventually, I decided to run after him so that he would not get lost or hurt. Mom stayed on the
            trail
            to call Dad (who was at work a few minutes away). Running after <span class="tooltip" style="margin: 0px;">
                Frank
                <span class="tool-tip-text black-outline" style="width: 130px;margin-left: -65px;">Name changed</span>
            </span> was hard. Clamoring over downed trees
            and
            rocks, I called after him. Finally, after what felt like forever, I caught up to him.</p>
        <p>I did the only thing I could think to do. I restrained him like I had seen my parents do countless times
            before.
            Standing behind him, I wrapped his arms in front of him, as if he was giving himself a hug. Making sure his
            hands were stuck firmly at his sides, I just stood there, waiting for Dad to come and rescue me. He was,
            obviously, not very happy about that. He was spewing hurtful things as we stood there. “I hate you” “You
            don't
            love me,” and the like. All the while, I kept muttering, “You are okay; you are safe.” I kept repeating this
            over and over. I was saying this more for myself than I was for him. The truth is, I was scared. I was
            scared
            out of my mind. Holding him was like holding a cat that does not like you. I am sure that, if I was not
            holding
            on to a kid who was struggling as hard as he could, I would have been shaking.</p>
        <p>This was the first time I had ever had to do this to him. My parents had always been there to deal with him.
            They did an amazing job sheltering me from his fits for the first few years he was in our home. However,
            this
            time, I was on my own. Mom would not have been able to follow him into the woods. He even bit me! This was
            the
            most afraid I had been in my life.</p>
        <p>After what felt like a lifetime later, Dad showed up. I was more grateful to see him than I had ever been. He
            took <span class="tooltip" style="margin: 0px;">
                Frank

            </span> from me, and I just stood there in shock for a bit. I made sure to get back in the car that did
            not
            contain <span class="tooltip" style="margin: 0px;">
                Frank
                <span class="tool-tip-text black-outline" style="width: 130px;margin-left: -65px;">Name changed</span>
            </span> for the drive home. When we got home, I went straight to my room (as I normally did). I put in
            my
            headphones and turned up my music. That was how I always dealt with his fits. I always put in my headphones
            and
            tried to distract myself. That worked all right at the moment, but looking back, I wish I could have used
            better
            means to deal with the pain. I bottled it all up, and that is still affecting me to this day.</p>
