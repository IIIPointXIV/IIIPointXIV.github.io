            I wish I was not trans. It affects me in so many negative ways, and I do not see many positives. The world
            hates
            us. I hate myself. My family does not accept me. I need to prove it to everyone I meet. I need to worry
            about
            where I live and how bad their anti-trans laws are. I need to worry about my safety if I go outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world hates trans people's guts. I know that is very much an exaggeration. <a
                href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2022/06/28/americans-complex-views-on-gender-identity-and-transgender-issues/"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>
            It is a very vocal
            minority
            that hates us. However, this minority is in power in much of the US, and where they are not in power they
            make
            noise until they are catered to. This is getting better as it is also getting worse. In Colorado,
            gender-affirming care legally has to be covered by insurance, all the while trans people are essentially
            banned
            in Florida. So many states are horrible places, not only for trans people <a
                href="https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/june-anti-trans-legislative-risk" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>, but just also in general <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ZeXnmDZMQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a>.
            When your state is marked as “do not travel” for a significant amount of your population, you are doing
            something wrong. Someone who is big in Republican circles even said that, “Transgenderism must be irradiated
            from public life entirely”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/pU9y9dcM5NQ" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a> to which he got thunderous applause. They are calling for a genocide
            of us.
            Even
            though they may deny it, that is what it is. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpS9erVwTno"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[5]</a> I am constantly terrified, wondering if this is the
            day
            when I
            will finally become illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am worried about my safety. The trans/gay panic defense still exists in way too many states <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_panic_defense#State_laws" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[6]</a>. I
            am
            worried
            about my future in jobs. As a trans woman, I get the bad side of both deals. <a
                href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/resumes-including-they/them-pronouns-are-more-likely-to-be-overlooked.html"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[7]</a> <a
                href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/research/the-stem-gap/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[8]</a> <a
                href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[9]</a> This does not even
            mention the increased harassment I am sure to get for being a woman, trans, and a lesbian (or at least not
            straight).

            My family does not want to support me. I have been out to my parents for around eight months. In this time,
            their attitude towards accepting me has not changed one bit. They cannot even attempt to call me Nova. They
            wrote me a physical letter that said, among other things, how excited they were when they found out they
            were
            having me, and how long they had been thinking about calling me my dead name. They sent chocolate with it
            that
            looked nice, but I could not bring myself to eat it. I hope the garbage enjoys it. Furthermore, they said in
            that same letter how heartbroken they were that I was “choosing” to be trans. How much clearer can I be when
            explaining to them that I did not choose this? I have told them multiple times how I did not choose this;
            this
            is just who I am. They refuse to accept that. Dad has said that I am “asking them to go against everything
            that
            they believe in.” Apparently, God draws the line at being trans. Even though the Bible clearly says that
            “there
            is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” <a
                href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Galatians%203:28" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer">[10]</a> There is a whole rant that I could do
            about
            how stupid the Bible is, but this is neither the place nor time for that. My parents constantly object to me
            transitioning because “what if I regret it in the future?” So what? What if I do regret it in the future?
            The
            only drawback I see is that I have breasts now, and I do not see that as much of a drawback.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is hard for me to explain to people how I know that I am trans. Imagine trying to explain to someone who
            was
            completely blind from birth what the color blue looks like. Then try to explain to a baby what the fourth
            dimension looks like. That is how it feels to me to explain how I know I am a woman. I just know what it is
            like, like the color blue, but I am also lost in figuring out who and what I am, like the fourth dimension.
            Am I
            a woman? Am I non-binary? Am I a demigirl? Am I just deluding myself, and I am actually a man? These
            thoughts
            are constantly running through my mind. I do not know anymore. I keep telling people that I am a woman
            because
            that is just easier, but I do not know anymore. I am pretty sure that transitioning is the right idea for
            me,
            but I think my parents' insistence otherwise is getting to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            People from my family who do not accept me being trans say that they love me. I keep thinking, “You keep
            using
            that word; I do not think it means what you think it means.” <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTRKCXC0JFg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[11]</a>
            How can you love me when you do not accept
            a
            fundamental part of who I am? It is like saying that you love Calculus while hating numbers. Numbers are a
            fundamental part of Calculus, just like how me being trans is a fundamental part of me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hate myself. There I said it. I do not really say this to people much, but I feel it way too often. I hate
            how
            I am trans. I hate how I am so soft-spoken. I hate how ugly I am. I hate how I think that I am ugly. I hate
            that
            I feel so alone. I hate my past for messing me up. I hate how I have not gotten over the past that happened
            so
            long ago. I hate the people at the adoption agency who messed up my little brother, and, by correlation, my
            life. I hate how I cannot bring myself to love my siblings, because I am still scared from that little
            brother.
            I hate everything about myself. I joke about it sometimes, but it really is true. The positives of me are so
            outweighed by the negatives that I just cannot see the positives in myself. I hate that, no matter how hard
            I
            try, I always fall back into self-hating depression spirals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Am I writing this just to get sympathy from other people? Do I do anything that is actually for other
            people? Do
            I do everything just to feel better about myself? Do I try to help people as much as I can just so that they
            thank me so that I can maybe feel something? Am I really a good person? Do I even deserve people's love?
            People
            say that everyone deserves love; everyone deserves to feel like they belong. But do I? Sometimes it really
            does
            not feel like it. I know I am being dramatic, but this is just what depression does to me. I take everything
            to
            its logical extreme, even if it does not make any sense.
        </p>

            I want to open a group home for LGBT children who are lost or kicked out by their family, like the house in
            A
            Trans Tale. <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/inside-out-a-trans-tale/list?title_no=384132&page=1"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[12]</a> Do I want to do this because it needs to be done, and
            I want to help people? Or do I want
            to do
            it because I know that people would look up to me and love me if I did it. I do not think that it is the
            latter,
            but the self-doubt is creeping in.
        </p>

            I feel like I am doing nothing productive in my life. I am just coasting along through college, barely
            paying
            attention, all the while getting straight A's. School has always been hard for me, but not in the common
            way. It
            has always been really easy for me to get A's in everything. The hard part for me is accepting the praise I
            am
            given when I do well academically. I got Salutatorian in my high school class. People were
            congratulating
            me left and right, yet I felt nothing. I barely tried in that last year of school. I put maybe 3 hours a
            week
            into school (including live classes, which I never went to). I was plagued by depression, a worse depression
            than what I am battling now. I cried during that time. I never cry. The last time I cried was when my Dad
            had
            surprise brain surgery to remove a tumor. That was over one and a half years ago. I hate how I cannot cry.
            It
            feels as if part of me is missing. I was told that HRT would “unlock emotions.” It has not done that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes I want to die. Do not worry though, or do, I am not your boss. I am sometimes what I think is
            called
            apathetically suicidal. Basically, I want to die, but I hate myself too much to consciously plan a way to
            kill
            myself. Imagine being so depressed you cannot even bring yourself to kill yourself. Sometimes I think about
            what
            I have to live for. My future looks like shit. Getting a job in a field in which I do not want a job does
            not
            seem good. My parents and some of my family cannot even say my name <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dy_DASt7hDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[13]</a>. I
            have some friends, but I do not
            know
            how close we are. My one friend from high school lives on the other side of the country, and is going
            through
            his own share of garbage. I have some supportive family, but we were not super close and they also live far
            away. I am giving nothing positive to society. The job I do at work can be easily filled by some other
            person.
            It's nothing special. I will most likely get Valedictorian, but what does that bring me? I feel as if all I
            do
            is get in people's way. If I do send this essay thing to people, this is a lot to read through, in word
            count
            and in emotional weight. My coming out to my extended family is sure to mess up my parents' already fragile
            relationship with the accepting side of the family.
