    <p>Hello! I am IIIPointXIV and you have somehow found my website!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I do a lot of random things, so this site holds my blog/thoughts on them! You can go to the blog by clicking it
        up at the top or clicking <a href=".\blog\mainBlog.html">here!</a></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1 class="centered-text">About Me!</h1>
    <p>I am a trans girl who has been super nerdy since the day I knew how to be. I started coding using Scratch and
        MakeBlock oh so long ago, and I loved it so much. I've always liked learning how things work and solving
        problems. I am actually currently going to college for computer science! (I hate it oh so much tho) I spend a
        lot of my time reading (manga and "normal" books), watching anime/TV/movies, playing rhythm games (Etterna,
        BeatSaber, and osu!catch mainly), and working on this site! Don't forget about the oh so many things I will
        randomly hyperfocus on and spend way too much time on. Oh yeah, I do work a bit on school, but school has
        always come easy to me so it doesn't take up too much time.</p>
    <p>Why does this site look so horrible, you might ask. It's because I hate JavaScript with a passion. Also I'm not a
        very good UI designer and this is more for fun than anything.</p>
    <h4>Some random fun facts about me!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>My best time to solve a Rubik's Cube (3x3) is 23 seconds! Tho I usually am closer to 30s I just got lucky.
        </li>
        <li>I have wayyyyy too many anime figures. (Click <a
                href="https://myfigurecollection.net/profile/IIIPointXIV">here</a> to see my list)</li>
        <li>My fav artists are underscores, Glass Beach, and Ne Obliviscaris. I plan to talk more about them sometime
        </li>
        <li>C# is my favorite programming language. Don't fight me.</li>
        <li>My least favorite is python. I fucking hate that language. (JavaScript is a close second)</li>
        <li>I watch way too much YouTube/Twitch (I am hoping starting this site helps that)</li>
    </ul>
